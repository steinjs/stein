Stein is a framework for [SolidJS](https://solidjs.com) built on top of Vite to provide helpers and tools to make your life easier while developing SPAs. It is modular with a plugin system based on Vite plugins and a CLI to make it easy to get started.

## ⬇️ Install
The **recommended** way to get started using Stein is by running the command below:

```bash
npm create stein@latest
```
The process should look something like this:

![stein_cli](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b26aa5b-1471-4177-a8c1-e3d679a96853)

For more detailed instructions, please reference our [Getting Started](https://stein.js.org/docs/core/) guide.

## ⁉️ Why Stein?
Stein was created to fill a niche in the SolidJS community. We aim to create a framework that simplifies the initial project setup and provides a rich experience for a SolidJS SPA. SolidStart is a great choice if you wish to use SSR, but if you prefer using an SPA, Stein is the right choice for you.

### Features:
- A solid foundation for your SolidJS SPA
- Improved project scaffolding and setup using the Stein CLI
- Modular plugin system with plug and play experience (inspired by Nuxt)
- Zero-config integrations with popular libraries like Tailwind and UnoCSS (more coming soon)
- More coming soon (help us out!)
