Stein is a framework for [SolidJS](https://solidjs.com) built on top of Vite to provide helpers and tools to make your life easier while developing SPAs. It is modular with a plugin system based on Vite plugins and a CLI to make it easy to get started.

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Install
The **recommended** way to get started using Stein is by running the command below:

```bash
npm create stein@latest
```
The process should look something like this:

![stein_cli](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b26aa5b-1471-4177-a8c1-e3d679a96853)

For more detailed instructions, please reference our [Getting Started](https://stein.js.org/docs/core/) guide.

## ‚ÅâÔ∏è Why Stein?
We aim to create a framework that simplifies the initial project setup and provides a rich experience for a SolidJS SPA.
Our core philosophy is "do one thing and do it well", and in this case we just want an experience which is close to building a SPA using just Vite, but with some extra bells and whistles to improve developer experience. 
We are not trying to compete with the current offerings in the ecosystem but rather provide an alternative with some opiniated defaults provided by us.

### Features:
- A solid foundation for your SolidJS SPA
- Improved project scaffolding and setup using the Stein CLI
- Modular plugin system with plug and play experience (inspired by Nuxt)
- Zero-config integrations with popular libraries like Tailwind and UnoCSS (more coming soon)
- More coming soon (help us out!)
